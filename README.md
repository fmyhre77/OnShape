# OnShape
## Skateboard

### Description
My assignment was to construct a skateboard in OnShape, following a lesson. I had to follow each step exactly because there were assignments asking for the weight of your skateboard, and it had to be within .01 gram of the actual mass.

### Reflection
It was a long assignment, that taught me a lot of useful tools along the way which will help me with my future projects. 

## Deck

### Description
My assignment was to create a wooden skateboard deckm in OnShape, and add holes for assembly later.

### Reflection
It was hard to get the holes to pattern correctly at first but I discovered the "Solve" button which will almost always format your sketch in a way that makes it easier to extrude.

## Trucks

### Description
I was to make 3 two part truck system for the skateboard, and put the 2 parts together with a smaller bushing in between them.

### Reflection
I had to create the trucks part by part and it was interesting to see it come together and I was happy to get the mass right first try.

## Wheels and Bearings

### Description
My assignment was to create a skateboard wheel and a bearing to make it have the appearance of a true skateboard wheel.

### Reflection
In this assignment I used the revolve tool in OnShape for the first time, then added fillets to give it a real skaeboard wheel look.

## Assembly

### Description
My assignment was to assemble the trucks, board and wheels, then add bolts and screws to add a real effect.

### Reflection
It was much easier in OnShape than on previous enginerring programs my school has used to add in bolts and screws, which I liked. I used two types of mates to secure all the parts and finish my board.
